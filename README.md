Assignments demonstrating my work at the GW bootcamp 
Hello, Attached is a copy of my completed assignment after a very long struggle. I faced a lot of struggles with completing this assignment. First hurdle was had to do with not getting enough support from the TA.

# Issues surrounding Visual studio
I also faced alot of difficulties with my visual studio. However, I testing the syntaxes provided with someone else and they worked well. But whenever, I returned to my own device, they didn't work. This cause me uninstall my visual studio about 5 times. So, it probably an issue with my computer. Subsequently, If I face similar difficulties, I'll just provide the syntax for each question on notepads for the graders to run and see if they work well. Atleast it is another way of demonstrating knowledge and willingness to do research and the work. Moreover, I believe that in the work environment, despite all the odds I'll still have to deliver. So if the syntax doesn't work on my device, I provide what I found, so that it can be modified and run on another computer that works well. 

Subsequently, if I run any syntax on my computer and it doesn't work, then I'll just provide a notepad with the syntax for grading. I don't mind losing points for the product. Moreover, I'll also be expecting feedback on my challenges to see how I can make significant improvement.


please see the file that called "pycitysch_syntax.txt" for all the syntaxes used. Thank you.
